            <p>
                Welcome! KKMerch is an online store that makes buying Korean pop albums easier. 
                Along with albums, later you will be able to get merchandise and general Korean beauty products.
                The Korean Pop market has been growing exponentially all around the world. 
                With more and more people becoming fans of one group or another, it is a guaranteed money market as of right now. 
                This is especially the case with BTS getting American Celebs hooked as well.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Most sites that were used for analysis only had albums from groups from a specific company while we have more variety in that sense and are planning on expanding the amount of groups. 
                Overall, our prices are less expensive than the competitors. 
                Once our expansion is set, we will have a lot more options for customers to choose from and ways for them to customize their little bundles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a few ways that we are planning to expand our business, first we are going to sell more albums from the groups that we already have and will expand on our groups as well. 
                Second, we will be selling kpop merchandise and korean products as well, allowing the customers to create their own bundles or by creating our own and selling them. 
                As of now the company does not plan on selling them separately.
